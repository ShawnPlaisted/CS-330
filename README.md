# CS 330 – Computational Graphics and Visualization
## Portfolio Reflection

### How do I approach designing software?

Working on this 3D scene project helped me build stronger design habits, especially in planning out how each object and function fits into the larger system. I followed a modular approach, where each major component (like the mug, knife, and microwave) was created through its own function. This made it easier to manage complexity and apply transformations and textures more cleanly. In future projects, I plan to continue using this kind of modular design process since it improves readability and makes troubleshooting simpler.

### How do I approach developing programs?

Throughout the development process, I used a lot of trial and error to dial in object positioning, lighting, and camera control. Iteration was key—every change I made taught me something new, whether it was about how lighting reflects off surfaces or how camera movement affects user experience. Over the course of the milestones, my code evolved from a basic layout into a more structured and reusable system. I’ve learned the importance of breaking work into phases and revisiting earlier steps with new insight.

### How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

This course gave me hands-on experience with graphics programming and visual scene design—something I hadn’t worked with deeply before. Even though I may not focus solely on computer graphics in my career, the logic behind spatial reasoning, transformations, and lighting will help me wherever 3D or UI/UX design is involved. These skills also give me more confidence in working with visualization tools or collaborating with developers in those spaces.
